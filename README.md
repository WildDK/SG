Usage
>> The aim of the project was to create 2D Shooter
Game using PyGame module. The game map is built
up using individual tiles arranged in a grid. The main
goal of the player is to move through the map killing
enemies using gun or grenades.
MAP
>>The game map is built up using individual tiles
arranged in a grid. There are three initial levels and a level editor is
included to allow for expansion of the game.
PLAYER
>>The main character can move using WASD,
SPACE to shoot and Q to throw grenades. The
player has limited amount of HP, bullets and
greandes. Player also can find additional HP,
bullets or grenades during his journey.
ENEMIES
>>The enemies have AI, which allows them to patrol
their area back and forth until they spot the player at
which point they will stop and shoot.
